`atuin` manages and synchronizes your shell history! Instead of storing 
everything in a text file (such as ~/.history), `atuin` uses a sqlite database.
This lets us do all kinds of analysis on it!

As well as the expected command, this stores

- duration
- exit code
- working directory
- hostname
- time
- a unique session ID
